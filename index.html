    <h1>WelCome to React or React.js or ReactJS</h1>

    <h1>Model-View-Controller Architecture (MVC Architecture)</h1>
    <p>Model-View-Controller is an architecture pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts - Model, View, and COntroller</p>

    <p>view -- controller  -- Model</p>
    <span>user -> gives request to controller(1) then request go to data i.e model(2) then renders Data fetch data and goes back to Controller(3) then sends date to View(4) it will be displaed o/p as result</span>

    <h1>What is React ?</h1>
    <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a javascript library for building user interfaces</p>
    <p>React is used in the development of single page web application or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded</p>
    <p>{;}JS i.e JavaScript + <>HTML = {<>}JSX  i.e. ReactJS </p>

    <h1>Features of React</h1>
    <p>React offers many inbuilt component libraries for faster execution</p>
    <p>Elements like JSX, Components, Props, State and Virtual DOM, let React to develop application faster with smaller code size, easy deployment, and rich user interface</p>
    <p>Top corporations such as Facebook, New York Times, Yahoo! Mail, Netflix, Instagram and more use it to solve their user interface relted issues</p>

    <h1>How to install React</h1>
    <p>Just to open folder path i.e. c/users/documents/Batch56 & select it & cmd to type & Enter</p>
    <p>Cmd will open i.e. c:\users\Document\Batch56> npm install create-react-app -g (give enter) here "g" means global i.e it will work every where...Run audit </p>
    <p>Now we have to create react application in cmd c/users/documents/Batch56> create-react-app project.js (this is file name). It will create folder after this open visual studio & open folder here it automatically {..}package.json file is created already. also in cmd still installation is going on i.e react, react-dom, react-script with cra-template. Now wait till it gets completed. Happy Hacking! </p>
    <p>now open terminal -> npm run start</p>

    <h1>What is DOM ?</h1>
    <p>DOM (Document object model) is a programming interface for SVG documents, XML, HTML . It is a standard which is followed by Browser, javascript engines, XML processors etc.</p>
    <p>In general DOM is tree structure composed of grouped nodes. It provides an approch way of retrieving, storing and modifying these nodes. </p>
    <p>The framworks on which by default HTML works is XML Extensible markup Language, DOM -Example useing XML File.</p>
    <Employees>
    <Employee>
    <Name>John</Name>
    </Employee>
    <Employee>
    <Name>Bob</Name>
    </Employee>  
    </Employees>
    <p>The above Example depicts a tree structure of DOM. AT the root, there is a node named Employees. This in turn contains two child node of Employee. Each child Employee node contains a node named "Name". The tree structure is Employees-> Employee -> Name.  You can traverse from Parent to child or vice versa. </p>


    <h1>How is Virtual Dom Different</h1>
    <p>Retrived <- Dom Element <-Updated <-Created -><- Web browser Performs a operations </p>
    <p>for e.g. in fb if you give post then your frd gives like,msg to your post this will be seen to you, somthing is happening i.e. virtual & once you refresh page -> everything will be shown i.e likes, msg, all</p>    
    <p>Virtual Dom-> It creates one tag and tried to populate/update it automatically. So what will happen is your same cades & lines are not gone & no need to repeated storage space is same & timing is same becz of this what we have update it will get retrive over there & respond over there </p>
    <p>e.g.Facebook-> The profife of your & 2nd frd is completely same to 3rd frd profile. Only data is changed means what new data are field only that is different rest all will be same. SO that the page loads the faster in this case. </p>
